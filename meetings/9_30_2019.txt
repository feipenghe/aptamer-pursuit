Agenda:
1. Background of this project
2. Dataset to consider
3. Current Literature
4. ML Techniques to start with
5. Wet lab experiments

Notes:
- Start with the MHC Dataset that is used for the MHCSeqNet paper. This is an approximate dataset, it won't fulfill our purposes exactly but it will be good to start with. 
- Randomly synthetic data is not going to be useful in this case, it could lead us a different way. 
- Initial models should be 1-gram, 2-gram, 3-gram. We start with something simple, it should fail. This will help us rule out this case later down the line. 
- The goal of this project is to accelerate the SELEX pipeline. Given a new peptide, it should accelerate the process of finding aptamers with high binding affinity to this peptide. 
- We can play around with different representations of the peptide sequences- one hot encoding might not be the best option becaue it doesn't reflect sequence properties. 
- The outcome of this model would be a process that identifies the most likely to bind aptamers. It's not a classification or recommendation problem --> we'll need to discuss this more. 
- Binding affinities can be represented on a spectrum as well as in a binary way. For now it might make sense to start with a binary (it binds or it doesn't). 

Next Steps:
- Read the MHCSeqNet Paper 
- Look into the MHC dataset and prune it to fit my purpose right now
- Experiment with 1-gram, 2-gram, 3-gram models 
- Document the progress on the README
- Generate hypotheses for how the models should react to new data (and then wait for experimental data)
- Meet with Kevin's student sometime next week (since we have similar projects)
