# A bigram predicts the likelihood of the current element based on the previous element.

# Construct a training dataset:
corpus = ["He said thank you.", "He said bye as he walked through the door.", "He went to San "
        "Diego.", "San Diego has nice weather.", "It is raining in San Francisco."]

# Probabilities: (Count (wp wn))/(Count (wp))



# Write the model


# Train the model


# Test the model
